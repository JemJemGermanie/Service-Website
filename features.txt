User Installation Guide:
Since this deliverable is focused on the frontend, a guide to deploy the website doesnt really apply,
due to the lack of backend implementation. However, as most of the data is hard-coded, and initialized
on the home page, if one would like to tweak this base data relating to business info, offered
services, and client info, they can access the data-init.js file and modify the values there.
